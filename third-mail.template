Subject: Second notice: Possible retirement of {{ devname }}
Bug-Title: Retire: {{ fullname }} ({{ devname }})
Bug-Comment: Third mail sent.

Dear {{ firstname }},

Possible retirement pending as you haven't shown no or very little
activity in the past eleven (or more) months.

{% if lastcommit %}
- Last commit activity:
  {{ lastcommit }}

{% endif %}
If you are just away, then please use the devaway system. Any developer
found to be inactive for a period in excess of 12 months is subject
to be retired.

While we hate to lose a developer who has made such an impact on Gentoo,
Retirement team is tasked with the maintenance of our developer pool,
including the retirement of inactive developers and revoking their
access privileges.

We do understand that life brings us unexpected changes and you simply
may not have the time, resources, etc. to contribute on a more frequent
basis, every month or two is the preferred minimum. If we do retire you,
it's pretty easy to come back when you are ready. Just do
the ebuild/end-quiz again and you're back on. You also always have
the option of contributing as your schedule allows via proxy
or bugzilla.

Please reply and advise on your situation. Please be aware that if we
have not heard from you within 3 months' time, we will begin
the retirement process.
