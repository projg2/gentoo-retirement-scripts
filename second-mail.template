Subject: Possible retirement of {{ devname }}
Bug-Title: Retire: {{ fullname }} ({{ devname }})
Bug-Comment: Second mail sent.
Bug-Whiteboard: second-email-sent: {{ today }}

Dear {{ firstname }},

Possible retirement pending as you haven't shown no or very little
activity in the past eight (or more) months.

{% if lastcommit %}
- Last commit activity:
  {{ lastcommit }}

{% endif %}
If you are just away, then please use the devaway system. Please be
advised that devaway may also be considered inactive if it extends past
60 days.

We do understand that life brings us unexpected changes and you simply
may not have the time, resources, etc. to contribute on a more frequent
basis, every month or two is the preferred minimum. If we do retire you,
it's pretty easy to come back when you are ready. Just do
the ebuild/end-quiz again and you're back on. You also always have
the option of contributing as your schedule allows via proxy
or bugzilla.

Please reply and advise on your situation. Any developer found to
be inactive for a period in excess of 12 months is subject to be
retired. Please be aware that if we have not heard from you within
6 months' time, we will begin the retirement process.
